# visualize SCC (strong connected components) using d3 force directed graph
Code-SCC.cpp uses tarjan algorithm to output SCC and edges connecting them to res.txt;
There may be many edges connecting two components, repeat.py output clean.txt leaving only one edge so in visualization edges do not overlap;
clean.txt â†’ mis.json
index.html uses force simulation in d3. By giving edges repulsive force in simulation to separate components and make sure edges do not cross each other.
